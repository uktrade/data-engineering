# Data Engineering Manual

At the Department for International Trade, we see data engineering as a specialisation of software engineering. 
Of course we build data pipelines, and move and transform data from one place to another, but we also build tools 
to enable others working with data. 

Such approach requires a broader set of skills from the practictioners, it requires ability to work with both software and data. 

This repository is an attempt at explaining our approach to data engineering, and collect resources to help 
find and share the necessary knowledge and skills. 

While we start with how we work as data engineers in our department, we will keep this document open. 
Some organisations may find it helpful. Others might disagree with our approach and hopefully we will have 
an opporutnity to discuss it and learn someting new.
